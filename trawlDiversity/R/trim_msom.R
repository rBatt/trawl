#' Trim trawl data for msom
#' 
#' Performs the \code{trawlTrim} function the clean region data, then trims down to species (not genera) that have been observed at least 10 times. Does aggregating within a haul/ spp using \code{trawlAgg}. Adds an abundance column, which is actually just 0 if wtcpue == 0, and 1 if wtcpue > 0.
#' 
#' @param reg Character name of region or data.table to be passed to \code{\link{trawlTrim}}.
#' @param gridSize numeric grid size to be passed to \code{\link{ll2strat}}
#' @param grid_stratum logical, default TRUE; whether or not the strata should be defined on a grid, or used original stratum definition
#' @param depthStratum The depth range to use to define stratum; the default does not use depth at all. If using, a reasonable value might be 100.
#' @param tolFraction The fraction of years that a stratum can not be sampled yet still be included in output. Default is 1/3, indicating that a stratum will be included in output so long as it is sampled for at least 2/3 of years. Actual number of years tolerated is rounded up. This value determines the strat_tol argument in \code{\link{check_strat}}
#' @param plot Logical, default FALSE; for \code{check_strat}, should the stratum tolerance be plotted?
#' @param cull_show_up Logical, default \code{FALSE}; should spp in \code{\link{show_up_spp}} be removed when trimming?
#' 
#' @return
#' A data.table
