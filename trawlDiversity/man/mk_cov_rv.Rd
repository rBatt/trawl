\title{Make Covariate (and their powers) a RV}
\usage{
mk_cov_rv(X, cName, across, by)

mk_cov_rv_pow(X, cName, across, by, pow = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{data.table}

\item{cName}{name of covariate}

\item{across}{RV is computed across this dimension}

\item{by}{RV is computed separately for each of these dimensions}

\item{pow}{Raise to this power. Default is 2.}

\item{A}{The random variables being operated on}

\item{sigma_A}{Standard deviations of A}

\item{b}{The exponent}

\item{a}{the multiplication coefficient}
}
\value{
NULL is retured, but the data.table is modified, with appropriate columns. Original covariate column will be modified.
}
\description{
Get the mean and SD of a covariate
}
\details{
Adds columns for the covarate, it's power, and both their sd's. Columns for SD's are named by appending "_sd", column for power is named by appending the numeric value of \code{pow}.

Of the form f = a*A^b. Sigma must be provided. Elements of A are treated as potentially separate RV's.

\section{Functions}{
\itemize{
\item \code{mk_cov_rv_pow}: Get the mean and SD of a covariate, and the same for the covariate^pow
Propagate standard deviation from raising to power

Calculates the standard deviation of a random variable created by multiplying another RV by a constant and raising it to a power
