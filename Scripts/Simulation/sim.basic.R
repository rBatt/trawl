# after seeing these plots, I'm a bit torn about which approach to use. Given that they aren't wildly different, KS test has an advantage b/c it is an established test, and the statistical interpretation of the p-value of this test is spot-on: the probability that a temperature was drawn from the same distribution as the temperature values previously-observed to be associated with the species. On the other hand, the reason the dsample() method gives higher "probabilities" within the previously-observed temperature range is b/c it's assumed to be 0 outside that range; which can be useful in its own right. However, even on the off-chance that the KS p-value allows a species to expand far outside its previous observed temperatures, this isn't all that unreasonable if temperature isn't given too much of a physiological interpretation and is simply viewed as a correlate of suitable habitat. I think that in this case the KS will win out b/c it'll be much easier to explain and defend.
# Also, I've later realized that dsample() is much faster than doing the mapply with ks.test. I can't think of a way to better program an implementation of ks.test without digging into its source code, because as-is, if x in ks.test is a vector, the probability returned is simply the probability of the x and y distributions being different.
