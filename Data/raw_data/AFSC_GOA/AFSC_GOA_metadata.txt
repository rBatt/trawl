		Gulf of Alaska bottom trawl survey data. Files are divided by year. A vessel goes out on a cruise, visits various stations, and conducts hauls with the bottom trawl. Each line is a species caught on a haul/tow.
	
		LATITUDE: latitude at start of a survey haul
		LONGITUDE: longitude at start of a survey haul
		STATION: station identication number for the haul
		STRATUM: statistical stratum of the haul
		YEAR: year of haul
		DATETIME: date and local time of the haul in MM/DD/YYYYHH:MM
		WTCPUE: weight in KG/hectare. -9999 for NA
		NUMCPUE: number, in number/hectrare. -9999 for NA
		COMMON: common name
		SCIENTIFIC: scientific name
		SID: species ID
		BOT_DEPTH: depth of the bottom at the location of the haul
		BOT_TEMP: temperature at the bottom
		SURF_TEMP: surface temperature
		VESSEL: vessel identification ID
		CRUISE: cruise identification ID
		HAUL: haul identification ID

	goaStrata.csv
		Area for each statistical stratum in the Aleutian Island, Eastern Bering Sea, Gulf of Alaska, and Northeast US surveys. Not all files have all fields.
	
		NPFMCArea: region name
		SubareaDescription: subarea name
		StratumCode: code for the stratum (matches STRATUM in ai, ebs, and goa files)
		OldStratumCode: stratum code from older classification system (only neus)
		DepthIntervalm: range of depths for the stratum, in meters
		Areakm2: area of the stratum in km2
		Areanmi2: area in square nautical miles
