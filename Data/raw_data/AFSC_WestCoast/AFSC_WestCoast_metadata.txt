Alaska Fishery Science Center West Coast bottom trawl survey

	All files in this folder were originally output from an ACCESS database from Bob Lauth, Bob.Lauth@noaa.gov, Alaska Fisheries Science Center and Mark Wilkins, Mark.Wilkins@noaa.gov (now retired, AFSC). This survey is no longer operational. It has been replaced by the NWFSC Annual bottom trawl survey.
