Begin Ryan Changes

BGSREC_ryan.csv
	created b/c fread() (data.table package in R) on original file misread col names
	is copy of BGSREC.csv, but resaved in Excel 
	

GLFREC_ryan.csv
	created b/c fread() (data.table package in R) on original file misread col names
	is copy of  GLFREC_ryan.csv, with following changes:
		read in using read.table(), then re-saved using write.table
		the “X” column is accidental byproduct of read/write above

STAREC_ryan.csv
	created b/c fread() misread col names
	is copy of STAREC_ryan.csv, with following changes:
		several columns deleted in Excel
		MO_DAY_YR contains dates in yyyy-mm-dd format (eases conversion to POSIX)
		START_DATE and END_DATE formats changed to yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM

INVREC_ryan.csv
	created b/c COMBIO column contained characters that created problems for reading
	is a copy of INVREC.csv, with the following changes:
		the column COMBIO was deleted (there may have been a blank column after it that was also deleted)

NEWBIOCODESBIG_ryan.csv
	created b/c fread() was not finding column names
	is a copy of NEWBIOCODESBIG.csv, but simply resaved in Excel as a .csv

CRUISES_ryan.csv
	created b/c fread() was not finding column names
	is a copy of CRUISES.csv, with the following changes:
		deleted columns NOTE, INGEST_SOURCE, INGEST_PROGRAM_VER
		changed date formatting of STARTCRU and ENDCRU to yyyy-mm-dd
			note: may have been this originally, but Excel changes
