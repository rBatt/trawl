Description: Simulates species occurrences based on an environmental gradient.
    Simulation can be over multiple years, and the years can be truly independent,
    or they can represent a dynamic occupancy. The environmental gradient can
    similarly be given a linear slope. Given a true occpancy state, species can
    then be observed. Observed occupancy can vary among species, and over time. For
    a given true occpancy and observed occupancy process, replicate sequences of
    observations can also be generated.
