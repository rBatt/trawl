Trawl data started in the 1980's (well, the useful stuff)

Gear was standardized in 1983 (for the Quarter 1 survey)

Quarter 3 survey started in 1991

Abundance at length data – need to convert to biomass via length-weight regressions; Robertson et al 2010 has most of the regressions in it


Look out for 2m long sprat 

SpeciesCodeType is the database (e.g., T is tsn)
SpeciesCode is the number for that taxon in the databse


Cephalopods and crustaceans are in the database – may want to co


How Georgina removed bad species– she uses species codes, and gets the taxonomy, and then filters out unwanted families etc


LngtCode tells you what units they measured it in
TotalNo tells you how many they caught
HLnoAtLngt tells you how many fish they measured


NoMeas*SubFactor=TotalNo (where TotalNo is the number they caught for that species in that haul across all lengths)

HLNoAtLngt*SubFactor= total number of fish at that length in the haul (sometimes HLNoAtLngt is precorrected, but if it is precorrected the subfactor would be 1, so don't be confused if the other columns suggest that the subfactor can't be1)

TotalNo is always the total number of the fish in the haul (for that species) – sometimes this will be equal to the NoMeas if the subfactor is 1.

So if you adjust the HLNoAtLngt to the Subfactor, then add up the HlAtLngt across all the lengths for that species, you should get the TotalNo column (and TotalNo should be constant for that species in that haul)


Correct LngtClass to a standard unit based on the LngtCode


The advise to discard night hauls, and to discard hauls that lasted less than 15 minutes


How to standardize the catch to the area:
Depends on 1) width of the net opening; 2) multiply by the speed of the boat and the duration

They are supposed to trawl at 4 naughts 

so (door or wing spread) * (duration) * (speed) = area swept

Their Effort in CPUE is "catch per hour"

DoorSpread and WingSpread (use one or the other, somtimes the appropriate one can depends on the species)
	There are published regressions to calculate DoorSpread and WingSpread from depth, these can be used in the values are NA (-9) in the data (ibts_sample)hauls.csv, e.g.
	Fung et al 2012 and Fraser et al 2008 and 2009
	
There are catchability corrections for many species (in one of the above Fraser papers), for each species at each length
	
Gear column in the data set – use the GOV gear type



Get max lengths for all of the species, and if anything seems to long, remove it

ShootLat and ShootLon tells you where the haul was taken

StatRec is the stratum
